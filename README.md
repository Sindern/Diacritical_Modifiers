For inserting diacritical macrons into text using hotkeys when trying to input Japanese romanization in the Hepburn Style.

Ctrl+Alt inserts lowercase āīūēō
Ctrl+Alt+Shift inserts capitals ĀĪŪĒŌ

NOTE: File encoding *must* be UTF-8 with BOM before running/compiling.

This was developed as an easy way to insert these characters for doing Japanese to English Translation Work
